# Process

This is a brief overview of how our team organized ourselves and worked together during sprint 0.

## Team Organization:

<b>How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?</b>

For sprint 0, our team of seven organized ourselves by evenly distributing the work needed to be done amongst ourselves. So for example, one person would complete the summary.md, another would do the competition.md, another the Personas.pdf and so on. Then, for both online using a Messenger group chat and in-person, we would update the rest of the group on our progress and say if we needed any help from another member. During such meetings, one person would also act as the scrum master, asking what each member did on their assigned task and leading the discussion to what should be done in the following week.

## Decision Making:

<b>How did you make decisions?</b>

In order to make decisions, such as deciding which client we would work for and the story points for each user story, we as a team discussed each topic together until we were all in agreement of whoever had the strongest argument. For example, for the deciding which project to do from the three available, we each brought up all the pros and cons for each one and weighed them against each other. In the end, we went with Fanlinc as we decided that it was much more realistic and possible to accomplish and achieve a good mark than the other two. The same could be said for deciding a user story's story points as the team brought up good arguments for the points they chose, where we could all come to an agreement in the end.

## Prioritizing User Stories:

<b>How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average)
did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?</b>

Our team defined the priority of user stories on a scale of high priority, medium priority, and low priority.
High priority user stories describe the core features and functionalities of our interpretation of the Fanlinc website that are expected to
be implemented at the minimum before any additional user stories can be implemented on top of them.

Medium priority user stories describe additional features that build on top of the high priority features but are not as important
to complete.
Low priority user stories describe features that only improve the overall user experience of the existing core features and any other new
features that are not as important to show that the website is functioning for the most basic features.

For the story points of our user stories, we used the Fibonacci sequence (i.e. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) to compare how difficult each story would potentially be compared to the rest.
The reason for this is that it allowed the team to easily discuss the complexity and difficulty for each user story as each member would have their own opinion about it.
If there any differing opinions for a user story, for example, one person would think that the story is easy to complete with a score 3 and another thinks its more difficult
with a score of 5, the two would discuss their ideas until both come to a mutual agreement on what must be the real story point estimate.

In terms of the number of rounds of voting, our team averaged about two rounds to come to a consensus. This is due to our team's exceptional ability to communicate
their interpretations and thought processes about each story, allowing us to quickly come to an agreement. So during the first round of voting, we would almost always
have one or two disagreements, and so all the different opinioned sides would express their ideas, and by the next round would come to an agreement with whichever side had the stronger
argument.
  
## Meetings:

<b>Did you meet in person or online? How frequently did you meet?</b>

For meetings, our team has met both online and in person. We used a Messenger group chat, Discord, and Slack to talk about any updates and questions that we have for each other on the fly, 
but usually, we would meet in person to have important team discussions, such as how to delegate the work and deciding the story points for user stories. Our in-person meetings would occur weekly as
our team wants to keep up to date with any changes and work that needs to be done. In case anyone is missing due to unforeseen reasons, they would be updated on what was discussed in the online chats.

## Next Phase:

<b>What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?</b>

For the next phase in sprint 1, we would definitely make sure that when we divide up the work, we are comfortable to complete the tasks assigned to us at a reasonable pace. This is because it can be
very easy for a person to fall behind in their work, which may end up blocking another person if they have to code on top of another person's code. We will also for
sure have weekly meetings as they are an essential part to keeping the team on track with each other's progress, and also utilize Messenger, Discord, and Slack for that purpose as well.
Overall, we as a team would be both self-aware of our own work ethic and of each other in order to achieve high results within the coming sprints.
