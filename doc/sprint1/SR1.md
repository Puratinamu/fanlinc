## Practices we should continue using in the following sprints
- learning new technologies we were previously unfamilliar with
- implementing features end-to-end 
- helping each-other on their tasks, if possible

## New practices we want to start using in the following sprints
- daily standups at 9 pm, via a quick conference call, recording the outcomes on a shared google doc 
- estimate story points before the start of the sprint
- learn how to use tests properly / effectively
- prepare presentation before the meeting with the TA for the closing of the sprint
- starting to close tasks on jira before the end of the sprint

## Harmful practices we should stop using in the following sprints
- leaving many things until the last minute and not taking initiative during uncertain situations
- not taking full advantage of jira
- disorganized presentation during the ta meeting
- poor communication: people not announcing their blockers / confusions / other issues

## Best/worst experience from sprint 1
- Best: learning how to work with springboot, discovering strengths of team members for the values they bring to the project
- Worst: testing using postman instead of groovy test suite
