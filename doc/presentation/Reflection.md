# Team Cloud-Infantry Software Development Process Reflection

## _Tools/techniques/conventions that worked well for our team_
From the start, we knew that we wanted to use Neo4j as the back-end database since that was going to be one of the main
topics taught in class, which we could then apply to our project. We chose to use React for our front-end because a
few of our group members had used it during their work term and it was something we felt we would be comfortable with. 
We quickly realized that there was a large learning curve with trying to use Neo4j with Spring-boot since most of us 
hadn’t seen this kind of specific architecture before. We were able to help each other out by sharing examples found 
online and pair program when necessary. After about two weeks of coding and learning, we all felt confident in our 
abilities to proceed with the back-end stories that were a priority. One of the things that we benefited greatly from 
is, having a dedicated chat for us all to communicate in, and daily standups on Discord voice chat, so that we could 
go over the progress and status of everyone’s assigned tasks and story implementations. We learned from our mistakes 
in the first week where we didn’t do standups and as a result, things got disorganized quickly. However, once we 
adopted the standup routine the team was on track.

## _Tools/techniques/conventions that didn't work well for our team_

One of the major challenges that we faced during each sprint was that we were all very busy with school and we were 
taking four to five other classes besides this one. It was a challenge to be able to work on the project and commit a 
meaningful piece of code daily as Ilir expected. However, we all managed to find time to set aside for the project and 
were able to complete the large story features that we and the product owner agreed were deemed important. Another 
convention that didn’t work as well for us was how some members took on the responsibility of only front-end tasks 
while others only back-end tasks for the web app. The consequence of this was that sometimes there was a disconnect 
between the front-end and back-end components, where for example, the front-end developer was blocked from finishing 
their task one endpoint did not work or is confusing in the back-end.

## _What our ideal process would look like_

An ideal process would also be that during our sprint planning meetings, we would fully break down how each task would 
be done so that we don’t over overestimate what needs to be done. Also, the requirements for the back-end and front-end 
components should be discussed thoroughly during sprint planning to minimize discussions between the front and the 
back-end developers during the sprint. We would also try to get our tasks done earlier in order to have an easier time 
integrating all the different components together.
