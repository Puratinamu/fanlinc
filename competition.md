# Competition
Fanlinc can be broken down into many little modules that function almost independently.
This means that we are in competition with any other company that focuses on those specific features.

Maps (Not necessarily going to be a final feature in the application): Apple Maps, Google Maps
- Google maps allows you to search for events, resturants, places, etc. Essentially anything that can be
tagged with some information and a geo-location. Fanlinc (maybe) will do this too except be specific to
picture locations, fan meetups, events. So long as fanlinc has this specialty, we believe that this will
allow for a more slick implementation.

Profile: Facebook
- Facebook allows you to fill out a profile with information like where you are from, what your intrests
are, etc. Fanlic does this too but like above, it is much more specific to fandoms. You can choose your 
level of commitment towards each category of fandom which is a feature unique to Fanlinc which seperates
it from it's competition.

Contacts: Facebook
- Contacts on Fanlinc can be categorized, and searched for based on types of fandoms and levels of interest
which is definitely something that other social media sites like Facebook can not do. 

Posts: Tumblr, Instagram, Facebook
- Posts are shown on a users profile which contain text and maybe images which other users should be able
to comment on. This is similar to Instagram, Facebook, and Tumblr. However much like everything else on
Fanlinc, posts will be categorized by fandom, level, and possibly other attributes which go above and beyond
just using regular hashtags to group posts together like on other platforms.

Chat: Discord, FB Messenger
- If this is possible to implement, chatrooms on Fanlinc would be specific to fandom, level, etc. and be very
specialized. Much like on Discord where an entire Discord server can be dedicated to one game or one
cosplayer, the same goes for a chatroom. 

Events: Facebook?
- Fanlinc really tries to focus the attention on grouping together people of alike intrests. Meaning that
planning and coordinating event attendance should be as simple as searching for events near you and clicking
join/attend. Facebook does this and lets you host public events where poeple can join or attend as well.
The difference with Fanlink is that (if possible to implement) events can show on the interactive map 
and users will be able to see what is in their imediate area which Facebook can not do.
