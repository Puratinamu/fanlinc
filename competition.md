Since Fanlinc can be broken down into many little modules that function almost independently.
This means that we are in compettions with any other company that focuses on those specific features.

Maps (Not necessarily going to be a final feature in the application): Apple Maps, Google Maps
- Google maps allows you to search for events, resturants, places, etc. Essentially anything that can be
tagged with some information and a geo-location. Fanlinc (maybe) will do this too except be specific to
picture locations, fan meetups, events. So long as fanlinc has this specialty, we believe that this will
allow for a more slick implementation.

Profile: Facebook
- Facebook allows you to fill out a profile with information like where you are from, what your intrests
are, etc. Fanlic does this too but like above, it is much more specific to fandoms. You can choose your 
level of commitment towards each category of fandom which is a feature unique to Fanlinc which seperates
it from it's competition.

Contacts: Facebook
- Contacts on Fanlinc can be categorized, and searched for based on types of fandoms and levels of intrest
which is definitely something that other social media sites like Facebook can not do.
