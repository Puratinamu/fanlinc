# Process

This is a brief overview of how our team organized ourselves and worked together during sprint 0.

## Team Organization:

## Decision Making:


## Prioritizing User Stories:

<b>How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average)
did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?</b>

Our team defined the priority of user stories on a scale of high priority, medium priority, and low priority.
High priority user stories describe the core features and functionalities of our interpretation of the Fanlinc website that are expected to
be implemented at the minimum before any additional user stories can be implemented on top of them.
Medium priority user stories describe additional features that build on top of the high priority features, but are not as important
to complete.
Low priority user stories describe features that improve the overall user experience of the existing core features and any other new
features that are not as important to show that the website is functioning for the most basic features.
