# FanLink Project Summary

## 1. Project Objective:

To build a platform which connects fans with a wide range of experiences in various fandom domains. The application categorizes
user profiles into finite communities, which help classify the user posts and filter the user feeds based on their associations with particular communities. This platform allows fans to view and contribute to chatrooms tailored to their profiles, as well as discovering and connecting with other fans who share similar interests. For optimal user satisfaction, the application supports
the ability for fans to search for existing fandom groups initialized by developers or other users, as well as creating their own fandoms if their community of interest could not be found. If possible, the application will achieve an even higher level of personalization by introducing more filters such as location and events which help bring the fan communities even closer.


## 2. The Key Personas (Users):

Jarrod - An artist who wants to get more people to love his music and attend his performances. He developed a passion for country music at the age of 10 years old when his cousin first brought him to an underground music performance, and thatâ€™s when he got inspired to write his own country songs. He always wondered how people find out about exciting events like the music performance he attended, so he spends a lot of his time searching various social media platforms for similar events, and has tough luck finding them. 

Miranda - 17-year-old cosplayer who recently moved from Calgary to study at the University of Toronto. She always feels really homesick because she misses her large group of friends, especially when she scrolls through her Instagram and sees that her friends regularly dress up and attend cosplay venues. She still has not met anyone at university who is a cosplay fan, but she really wishes she could make some new friends and go out with them and do what she always loves doing. No one seems to understand her unusual interests, so she feels lonelier than ever.


## 3. The Key Scenarios:

Jarrod - He wants to find out the time and location of country music concerts which take place in his area this week, because he cannot think of any better date ideas. He is especially interested in not so well known artists because of the popular ones are too expensive. Also, Jarrod wants to organize his own music event but has trouble gathering enough audience members to cover the cost of the venues he rents, so he needs a way to get the word out to more people who will likely be interested in attending.

Miranda - She wants to make new friends, so she needs to find people who are also interested in cosplay. After getting in contact with such people, she wants to discuss with them a possible time when they can hang out before school gets too busy.


## 4. The Key Principles:

Most importantly this platform needs to allow people to connect with likeminded individuals. Its priority is to create a sense of
community for users of different interests and hobbies. The experience and interest of individuals in certain fandoms is more
important than other features about these people - their age, gender and education should not have any relevance. Also, the proximity 
of events and other users in the community takes precedence over the size or popularity of that community.
