- members are professional                                                      (4/4)
    - everyone is generally business casual
        - some people could probably be a bit more formal but no marks deducted
- team communication                                                            (2/2)
    - good overview of communication and tools used
    - good overview of what you talked about and the discussions you had
- processes + standards                                                         (1/2)
    - overall explained fairly adequately
    - standards were not really standards
        - could have discussed criteria of satisfaction or coding conventions
        - the "standup standards" are more like guidlines for communication; they are not really standards for the project
- techniques                                                                    (2/2)
    - techniques are adequate

|category|mark|total|
|---|---|---|
|architecture presented clearly, illustrated with sufficient diagrams, responsibilities shown clearly|3|4|

**additional comments**:

- architecture                                                                  (3/4)
    - data flow diagram is ok
        - a little too general; wanted to see a more specific one taliored to your application
    - some of your diagrams are not particularly conventional to the class (i.e. not CRC or UML diagrams)
        - could have used a little more explanation as to what these diagrams are trying to convey
- technologies                                                                  (6/6)
    - went over pretty well in detail
        - could have used some more explanations but generally was ok
        - liked how you went over testing technologies as well
    - technical challenges
        - good challenges
        - good solution for each challenge

|q2|2|2|
|questions asked in professional tone|1|1|

**additional comments**:

- questions:
    - lessons learned from the project
        - good level of depth to this question
    - experiences using flask
        - good question; trying to get others' experience using technologies he's used before
    - additional questions:
        - any features that weren't in the initial plan? any features that you didn't finish?
            - team's response was kind of generic and unsatisfactory; could have pressed harder on this
        - why did the team set up their own map? did it take a lot of time to implement?
            - good question; team's response was not very good and pretty unclear
        - clarification on not using the google maps API
            - again, the team's response is not very good
        - was making the map a manual process?
